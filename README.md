# Follower Count Game
This code is a simple text-based game in which the player is presented with two accounts and must guess which one has more followers. The game is played in rounds, and the player's score is incremented each time they make a correct guess. The game ends when the player makes an incorrect guess.

# Getting Started
To run this code, you will need a Python interpreter. Additionally, the code uses the art and game_data modules, which should be placed in the same directory as the main code file.

# Usage
To play the game, run the code and follow the prompts. You will be presented with two accounts, and you must type "A" or "B" to indicate which one you think has more followers. If you guess correctly, your score will be incremented and you will move on to the next round. If you guess incorrectly, the game will end and your final score will be displayed.

# Known Issues
The code does not currently handle input validation, so entering anything other than "A" or "B" may cause the code to crash.

# Future Development
* Implement input validation to handle invalid user input.
* Add additional elements to the game, such as a timer or a difficulty level
* Add the option for the player to choose the specific social media accounts to compare.
* Implement a scoring system to keep track of multiple rounds of the game.
